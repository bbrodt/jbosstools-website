Gorkem Ercan and Burr Sutter will discuss the principles of building hybrid mobile applications and demonstrate how JBoss Developer Studio can ease the task. Demos will include:

* A complete development cycle for a hybrid mobile application.
* Creating a project, editing it, then running it on platform emulators without leaving the integrated development environment (IDE).
* The Cordova plug-in discovery and management features of the tools.
* The convenience of using the new Cordova Simulator, which incorporates Ripple and live reload to test and debug mobile hybrid applications.
* How to create the final package for a mobile application and submit it to an application store.
